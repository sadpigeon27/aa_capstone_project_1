                    <p class="cat-p">
                        Meet Teddy, a 2-year old black and white cat we adopted recently. He likes rolling on the floor picking up all the dust,
                        laying across doorways and screaming when he's bored. He's an incredibly playfull yet surprisingly lazy cat with a friendly nature.
                        The decision to adopt him was a spontaneous one, yet we never regretted it, as he brought some long-lacking fun and activity
                        into our home, and we are happy to give him back with all our love. The following two paragraphs were written by ChatGPT just to
                        meet App Academy's requirements for this capstone project.

                    <p class="cat-p">
                        The black and white cat, with patches of ebony fur intermingling with spots of pure snow, roamed the silent streets with a graceful
                        elegance. Her green eyes shimmered like emerald jewels in the moonlight, reflecting the serene tranquility of the world around her.
                        She was a creature of the night, whispering secrets to the silent moon and dancing with shadows. Her paws made no sound on the cobblestone
                        streets as she wandered, exploring the unseen and unknown corners of the world.

                    <p class="cat-p">
                        This feline harbored an air of mystery, a silent observer of the world around her. Her contrasting fur symbolized the duality of her nature.
                        By day, she was a playful and loving companion to her human, purring softly and curling up in sunlit patches. By night, she transformed into
                        a silent guardian of the shadows, exploring the secrets of the dark. Her dual-colored fur was a canvas, painting a story of her adventures,
                        of whispered secrets, and hidden treasures discovered in the moonlit world.
