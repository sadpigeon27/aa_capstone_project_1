## Pages

The bulk of the following plan was taken from the App Academy project as was required. I wil add my own notes to it as i go along with building the site.

1. index.html - Welcoming page with articles

    - ***Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages***
    - 1 header using H1
    - 3 sections of text with H2 headers
    - 1 image

2. form.html - the page with the form.
    - ***Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages***
    - HTML form with a minimum of:
        - 1 fieldset
        - 3 inputs
            - 2 text
            - 1 checkbox
        - 1 textarea
        - *Appropriate labels for the above*
        - 1 button

3. links.html - a list of links, will decide where to later.
    - ***Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages***
    - 1 header using H1
    - 1 ordered or unordered list of links to 5 other websites

4. images.html - a bunch of images. Decide of what later.
    - ***Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages***
    - 1 header using H1
    - 6 images displayed 3 wide and 2 down
        - A label for each image
        - Clicking on the image opens the source of that image in a new window
